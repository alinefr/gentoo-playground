=================
This repository contains ebuilds which fall into the following categories:

* ebuilds modified from those in portage for supporting
  additional features (usually with new USE flags)

* version bumped higher than those yet in the portage tree

* fixed ebuilds for updated dependencies or where there is
  bug in the portage version which hasn't yet been fixed

* all new packages not currently in portage
